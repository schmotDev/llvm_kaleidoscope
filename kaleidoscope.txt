Lexical:

2 "reserved" words for our language:
- extern = instruction to add external code
- def = to define a function

we can have
- identifier
- number

identifier can be variable name
identifier can be a function name

number are float only (double)
can be written as x.xx or .xx
(have to check the lexer as it will accept xx.xx.xx )
